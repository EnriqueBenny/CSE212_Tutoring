# Programming with Data Structures (CSE 212)

#### Intro
Welcome to CSE 212, this online resource will be here to give you additional practice and tips throughout the semester. As the weeks pass, this resource will be updated with new materials. 

In each section, you will be walked through the different parts of the topic for the week. If you're already feeling comfortable with what is going on, feel free to skip down to the example or the challenge. For both the example and the challenge, have VS Code open and ready. You'll be copying and pasting the code into your program to work with it, rather than downloading the entire repository. 

>If there isn't an included topic that you would like to see, please reach out (contact information below). I have currently elected to only include the sections I feel people need the most help with for now.
